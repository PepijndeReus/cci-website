Max is excited to share some updates from his journey with [CCI](https://cci-research.nl/) over the past few months.

One of the highlights was the publication of the paper, “Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments” ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3689488.3689991)), which he had the privilege of presenting at [SPLASH 2024](https://2024.splashcon.org/) ([PAINT](https://2024.splashcon.org/home/paint-2024)) in Pasadena, California, last October. He attended the conference alongside Chris, Damien, and Thomas, who also delivered their own presentations ([post](https://cci-research.nl/post/splash-conf-2024/)). Sharing his work and receiving insightful feedback from so many brilliant minds marked a significant milestone.

On the academic front, Max is in the final stages of his master's thesis and is preparing for his defense later this month. Additionally, he recently began working part-time as a Student Research Assistant at CCI to continue the research from his thesis.

He looks forward to building on these experiences as he continues his work with CCI.
