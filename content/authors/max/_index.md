<h2>About Max</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Max. I grew up in Seattle, USA where my passion for technology and programming first ignited, and I’ve loved learning new things ever since. I moved to Montréal, Canada to study Computer Science and Physics at McGill, then headed to Ottawa to work as a software engineer at Cisco Systems for three years. In 2023, I wanted to learn more so I started a new adventure in Amsterdam to pursue my Master’s in Software Engineering at the University of Amsterdam. I am currently doing research focusing on experimental/exploratory programming environments.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me on the football pitch, tennis court, or out running. I also love tinkering with creative and engineering (hardware) projects.</p>
